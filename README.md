# Ann: simple construction of artificial neural networks
A toy project that simplifies construction of neural networks by allowing a user to specify layers in a list. Hyperparameters can be passed in to the speicifc layers or to the train method.


Features include:
- Hidden layers
- Convolutional layers
- Classification
- Multi variable regression
- GPU enabled
